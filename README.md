# frogger-vanilla-js
The very classic Frogger game using Vanilla JS << Grid based concept >>.

Frogger is a game where you (as a player) are a frog. There are obstacles on the way 
which you have to cross to reach your final destination. The first obstacle is the road
where you have little cars going from one side to the other. If any hits you, the game
ends. The second obstacle is the river. If the player falls into the river, the game ends 
but there are logs going from one side to the other, on which the player has to climb 
and pass the river. The third obstacle again are the cars. 

In the game above, we have little monsters(just a yellow square with a face) instead of cars and a green square with a face
instead of a frog.

***Recursive Algorithm for monster and log movement***

***Issue***
1. When the page is hidden, the game starts to break. (uneven setInterval)
